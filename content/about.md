# Biography

## Who am I?

My name is James Cooper. I am a Chicago native, currently studying in my third and final year at Covenant Theological Seminary near St. Louis, Missouri. I have been married two years to my wonderful wife Madeleine (in exile from the great state of Minnesota). We live in Overland, Missouri with our dog Teddy and cat Annabelle.

In anticipation of graduating this coming May, I am currently in the process of seeking a call. My ideal first position would be as a pastoral apprentice or assistant pastor working alongside an experienced minister or ministerial team. I am eager to learn, and would desire opportunities to continue growth in teaching, preaching, and ministering to adults.

## What do I believe?

I was raised Roman Catholic, though (and I mean this as no slight to my parents) with little in the way of formal catechesis. I am grateful to my parents, who created an environment in which I was exposed to the Bible and the basics of the Christian faith. This would prove foundational as I grew older, and became restless with the problem of sin and evil in my own heart.

At fifteen, after a period of intense struggle, I first understood the gospel ("good news") of the free forgiveness of sins through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, thanks in part to the writings of Martin Luther and an eclectic mix of sermons that I found on the internet. I counted myself a Reformed Christian, and still do to this day.

At a very fundamental level, I find it unfortunate that there should be "kinds" of Christians at all. The unity of the church is something which Christ desires ([Jn 17:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:21)), and yet, at certain points in the history of the church it has been necessary that traditions should split, so as to preserve the purity of the gospel, and to protect its hearers from gross error.[^1]

As a Reformed believer, I hold to the [ecumenical creeds](http://bookofconcord.org/creeds.php), the [five solas of the Reformation](http://www.theopedia.com/five-solas), and the [Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms](http://www.pcaac.org/resources/wcf/), as my confessions of faith.[^2]

[^1]: I do, however, consider Christians in other traditions to be my brothers and sisters. This is especially true of those in the Lutheran and Anglican branches of the Reformation, and also those who have remained Roman Catholic. There are, of course, those who deny fundamentals of the faith, most commonly the divinity of Christ, who I, along with the church throughout history, consider no Christians at all.

[^2]: This last one is not essential to Reformed identity. There have been many other great Reformed confessions written (e.g. the [Three Forms of Unity](https://www.urcna.org/1651/custom/24288)). The Westminster Standards have the distinct honor of having been written last (1647), and thus, in my opinion, epitomize Reformed faith and practice in a way unparalleled by other confessions.
