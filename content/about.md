# Biography

My name is James Cooper. I am a Chicago native, currently studying in my third and final year at Covenant Theological Seminary near St. Louis, Missouri. I have been married two years to my wonderful wife Madeleine (in exile from the great state of Minnesota). We live in Overland, Missouri with our dog Teddy and cat Annabelle.

In anticipation of graduating this coming May, I am currently in the process of seeking a call. My ideal first position would be as a pastoral assistant or assistant pastor working alongside an experienced minister or ministerial team. I am eager to learn, and would deisre opportunities to continue growth in teaching, preaching, and ministering to adults.
