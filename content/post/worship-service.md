What follows is a Sunday liturgy I designed. There are footnotes throughout explaining the various components of the liturgy, as well as my rationale for including certain things and placing them where I did.

*Rubrics are preceded by an asterisk (\*). They are intended to be said by the pastor, but not printed for the congregation.*

Brief Description
-----------------
*This description is given for the sake of thoroughness, and to make the point that the needs of an individual congregation may vary. This is a "traditional" liturgy that is at the same time eclectic, which I thought honoring to God, mindful of the historic church, and edifying to the particular worshippers I describe.*

The church I have in mind is an urban church in the upper Midwest. It is
still a relatively new church, with membership around 200. The average
age is in the early to mid-30’s, with many small children and quite a
few singles. The congregation is a mix of those from Christian homes and
those newer to the faith. Of those with church backgrounds, few grew up
reformed, with most either growing up Lutheran or Evangelical Free. They
are familiar with common hymns and worship songs, and pick up new songs
through imitation, but do not use hymnals. The worship ensemble consists
of vocalists, guitars, a piano, and a djembe. Most do not bring bibles
with them. Communion is celebrated every week, and is distributed
individually by the elders amongst the pews.

Call to Worship[^1]
-------------------

\* If you are visiting with us today, welcome. The LORD bids us all join
with all creation in praising him. Let us do that now.

\[Pastor\] Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth! Serve the
LORD with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!

**\[All\] Know that the LORD, he is God! It is he who made us, and we
are his; we are his people, the the sheep of his pasture.**

\[Pastor\] Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with
praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name!

**\[All\] For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and
his faithfulness to all generations.**

*Psalm 100:4-5*

Song of Praise[^2]
------------------

All creatures of our God and King \
Lift up your voice and with us sing, \
Alleluia! Alleluia! \
Thou burning sun with golden beam, \
Thou silver moon with softer gleam! \
\
*Refrain* \
*O praise Him! O praise Him!* \
*Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!* \
\
Thou rushing wind that art so strong \
Ye clouds that sail in Heaven along, \
O praise Him! Alleluia! \
Thou rising moon, in praise rejoice, \
Ye lights of evening, find a voice! \
\
*Refrain* \
\
And all ye men of tender heart, \
Forgiving others, take your part, \
O sing ye! Alleluia! \
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear, \
Praise God and on Him cast your care! \
\
*Refrain* \
\
Let all things their Creator bless, \
And worship Him in humbleness, \
O praise Him! Alleluia! \
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son, \
And praise the Spirit, Three in One! \
\
*Refrain*

*Francis of Assisi, trans. Wil­liam H. Drap­er*

\* What a privilege it is to know and to worship so great a God. He is so
glorious, and yet, we know that we have not served him with our whole
heart this week. Let us take a few moments to confess our sins to the
LORD, and ask for his forgiveness.

Confession of Sin[^3]
---------------------

*Silent Confession*

**\[All\] Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you
in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done, and by what we have
left undone. We have not loved you with our whole heart; we have not
loved our neighbors as ourselves. We are truly sorry and we humbly
repent, for the sake of your Son Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and
forgive us; that we may delight in your will, and walk in your ways, to
the glory of your Name. Amen.**

*From the Book of Common Prayer*

Absolution[^4]
--------------

\* If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie
and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in
the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus
his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. *(1 John 1:6-9)*

\[Pastor\] Brothers and sisters, by faith in Christ your sins are
forgiven.

\* Let us give thanks to God for the mercy he has lavished upon us in
sending the Son to die for our sins, and rise to give us new life.

Thanksgiving (Song)[^5]
-----------------------

In Christ alone my hope is found,\
He is my light, my strength, my song;\
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,\
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.\
What heights of love, what depths of peace,\
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!\
My Comforter, my All in All,\
Here in the love of Christ I stand.\
\
In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,\
Fullness of God in helpless babe.\
This gift of love and righteousness,\
Scorned by the ones He came to save:\
Till on that cross as Jesus died,\
The wrath of God was satisfied -\
For every sin on Him was laid;\
Here in the death of Christ I live.\
\
There in the ground His body lay,\
Light of the world by darkness slain:\
Then bursting forth in glorious day\
Up from the grave He rose again!\
And as He stands in victory\
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,\
For I am His and He is mine -\
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.\
\
No guilt in life, no fear in death,\
This is the power of Christ in me;\
From life's first cry to final breath,\
Jesus commands my destiny.\
No power of hell, no scheme of man,\
Can ever pluck me from His hand:\
Till He returns or calls me home,\
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.\
\
*Stuart Townend & Keith Getty*

Prayer for Illumination[^6]
---------------------------

\* **As we come to God’s word, let us ask for his help.**

**\[All\] Teach me your way, O Lord, that I may walk in your truth
(Psalm 86:11)**

\[Pastor\] Holy Spirit, we ask that you would be present in and with
your Word. Give us ears to hear and hearts to receive your truth. Work
in us, so that day by day we are conformed to the likeness of our Savior
Jesus Christ. Amen.

**Sermon Scripture**[^7]

\* Our Scripture reading for today comes from Colossians chapter 1, verses
15-21, which you may find in your bulletin. Again that is Colossians
chapter 1, verses 15-21. Please stand for the reading of God’s holy
Word.

*The pastor then reads Colossians 1: 15-21, followed immediately by the
sermon.*

Sermon
------

Title: The Supremacy of Christ \
Big Idea: Because Christ is the head, we should live boldly. \
FCF: When God’s enemies are strong, it is easy to lose hope. \
Main point 1: Christ is the head of creation. \
Main point 2: Christ is the head of the church. \
Main point 3: Christ is the head of all things.

\* Let us pray.

Service Prayer[^8]
------------------

\[Pastor\] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your Word. We thank you for
your apostle Paul, who reminds us that Christ has and will reconcile all
things. We pray that as we wander as pilgrims and exiles in an often
hostile world, that you would encourage us through your Spirit. We pray
for the grace to love and serve our neighbors, and the boldness to share
the good news of our Savior.

Song of Response[^9]
--------------------

Should nothing of our efforts stand\
No legacy survive\
Unless the Lord does raise the house\
In vain its builders strive\
To you who boast tomorrow’s gain\
Tell me what is your life\
A mist that vanishes at dawn\
All glory be to Christ!

*Refrain*\
*All glory be to Christ our king!\
All glory be to Christ!\
His rule and reign will ever sing,\
All glory be to Christ!*\
\
His will be done\
His kingdom come\
On earth as is above\
Who is Himself our daily bread\
Praise Him the Lord of love\
\
Let living water satisfy\
The thirsty without price\
We’ll take a cup of kindness yet\
All glory be to Christ!\
\
*Refrain*\
\
When on the day the great I Am\
The faithful and the true\
The Lamb who was for sinners slain\
Is making all things new.\
\
Behold our God shall live with us\
And be our steadfast light\
And we shall ere his people be\
All glory be to Christ!\
\
*Refrain*

Intercessory prayer[^10]
------------------------

\* As those called by God to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, let
us pray for the needs of those around us.

*\[Pastor\] Prayers:*

*For the congregation* \
*For the Church* \
*For the nation* \
*For the world*

Lord’s Prayer[^11]
------------------

\* Let us pray the words which our Lord taught us.

Our Father who art in heaven,\
hallowed be thy name.\
Thy kingdom come.\
Thy will be done\
on earth as it is in heaven.\
Give us this day our daily bread,\
and forgive us our trespasses,\
as we forgive those who trespass against us,\
and lead us not into temptation,\
but deliver us from evil.

\* Having brought our needs before the LORD, let us give in faith to his
work.

Collection of Alms[^12]
-----------------------

*The collection plates are distributed.*

\* We give because we are one body, united by faith in Christ. Let us
confess that faith together.

Creed[^13]
----------

\[Pastor\] Christian, what do you believe

**\[All\] I believe in God, the Father Almighty,\
Maker of heaven and earth.\
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,\
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,\
born of the virgin Mary,\
suffered under Pontius Pilate,\
was crucified, died and was buried.\
He descended into hell.\
On the third day He rose again from the dead.\
He ascended into heaven\
and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.\
From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.\
I believe in the Holy Spirit,\
the holy catholic Church,\
the communion of saints,\
the forgiveness of sins,\
the resurrection of the body,\
and the life everlasting. Amen.**

Invitation and fencing[^14]
---------------------------

\[Pastor\] We have just confessed our faith together. We have confessed
that through faith in Christ our sins are forgiven. If this is your
confession, then in a moment we will share a meal together through which
our Savior promises to strengthen us by faith. But if this is not your
confession, or if you have not made your confession known to a body of
believers and joined yourself to them, then I invite you not to partake,
as doing so would be both untruthful and harmful to you. Instead, I
invite you to watch and consider whether or not these things are so, and
to talk with me or one of the elders about any questions you have. We
are glad you are with us.

**Words of Institution**[^15]

\[Pastor\] The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,
and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body
which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he
took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my
blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as
often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's
death until he comes. *(1 Corinthians 11:23-26)*

Eucharistic Prayer[^16]
-----------------------

\[Pastor\] The Lord be with you.\
**\[People\] And also with you.**\
\[Pastor\] Lift up your hearts.\
**\[People\] We lift them up to the Lord.\
**\[Pastor\] Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

**\[People\] It is right and just.**

*From the Roman Missal*

\[Pastor\] Holy Spirit, be with us now. Set these elements apart for
your use, that we might be strengthened in faith and grow in love
towards God and neighbor. Lift us up to be with Christ; to eat his flesh
and drink his blood, through which we have attained peace.

Passing of the Peace[^17]
-------------------------

\[Pastor\] The peace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

**\[People\] And also with you.**

\[Pastor\] Please give one another the sign of peace.

*One minute will be allotted for the passing of the peace.*

\* Having been reconciled to God, we are reconciled to one another. Let us
eat his body and drink his blood together in remembrance until he comes
again.

Communion
---------

*The bread is distributed, the pastor says,* “The body of Christ, broken
for you~,~” *and all eat together. Then follows the wine, the pastor
says,* “The blood of Christ, shed for you,” *and all drink together*.

\* “For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever feeds on
my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him” (John 6:55-56).
Let us praise our Lord.

Song of Praise[^18]
-------------------

The church’s one foundation is Jesus Christ, her Lord;\
she is his new creation by water and the Word.\
From heaven he came and sought her to be his holy bride;\
with his own blood he bought her, and for her life he died.

Elect from every nation, yet one o’er all the earth;\
her charter of salvation: one Lord, one faith, one birth.\
One holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food,\
and to one hope she presses, with every grace endued.\
\
Mid toil and tribulation, and tumult of her war,\
she waits the consummation of peace forevermore,\
till with the vision glorious her longing eyes are blest,\
and the great church victorious shall be the church at rest.

Yet she on earth hath union with God the Three in One,\
and mystic sweet communion with those whose rest is won:\
O happy ones and holy! Lord, give us grace that we\
like them, the meek and lowly, may live eternally.

*S.J. Stone*

Benediction[^19]
----------------

\[Pastor\] The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face to
shine upon you and be gracious to you; the LORD lift up his countenance
upon you and give you peace. *(Numbers 6:24-26)*

[^1]: The call to worship is, first and foremost, a call from the LORD
    to his people. As an invitation to join with the heavenly hosts in
    praising the LORD, it naturally comes first, and sets the tone for
    the rest of worship. The congregation responds to the invitation as
    those already redeemed, come to give sacrifices of praise to their
    God. They begin by reciting his wondrous deeds of creation and
    redemption.

[^2]: The response of adoration for God’s mighty deeds continues through
    song. The psalm praises him for his acts of redemption, and the hymn
    praises him for his acts of creation.

[^3]: The congregation is now moved to reflect on their own inadequacy
    before the God whose majesty they have just adored. Sin causes a
    breach in fellowship between God and the worshipper, and confession
    allows true worship to continue.

[^4]: As redeemed children of God, those who confess are assured of
    forgiveness. I have chosen Absolution over Assurance of Pardon to
    underscore that forgiveness occurs *now*, and the application of
    pardon *to the one confessing* (a Lutheran emphasis). It is not a
    sacerdotal action, but a proclamation of the gospel to the
    individual conscience.

[^5]: Having received forgiveness, the faithful are led in thanksgiving
    particularly for the *person and work of Christ*.

[^6]: Since it is the work of the Holy Spirit to soften our hearts
    towards the Word, the pastor asks for his presence in and with the
    Word, *before* man’s action of reading and expounding upon it.

[^7]: The Scripture reading and the sermon form the climax of the first
    part of the liturgy. Having come into God’s presence and received
    pardon for their sins of the previous week, the people are prepared
    to hear for God through his appointed minister.

[^8]: The service prayer is distinguished from the prayer of
    illumination in that it has in view the word *already heard*.
    Without re-presenting the sermon, it petitions God for grace to
    apply these truths in the concrete realities of our lives, reaching
    beyond the worship service and into the coming week.

[^9]: The liturgy of the word ends with a song of response to God’s
    Word, ideally suited to the central themes of the sermon. It is a
    way both of giving thanks and further inculcating God’s word through
    song. This particular song highlights Christ’s supremacy over all
    things and our future hope.

[^10]: Having given to the ministries of the church, the congregation
    now intercedes on behalf of their own members, various ministries,
    and their neighbors. It may be helpful to print a list of prayer
    requests in the bulletin for worshipper to follow along with and
    take home for reference throughout the week.

[^11]: The Lord’s Prayer is included every week as an aid to memory and
    as a template for corporate and individual prayer in general. It
    includes even those elements of prayer which may not have been
    featured elsewhere in the intercessory prayer. It also invites the
    people to join their voice in prayer.

[^12]: Like Calvin, I have chosen not to call this an offertory, in
    order to avoid confusion over the means of forgiveness (or, as
    Chapell notes, the purpose of the sermon). The collection is
    included in the Liturgy of the Upper Room, which focuses upon the
    communion which believers share with one another as they all share
    communion with Christ. Gifts are given for the ministries of the
    church, in which all participate. It comes after the intercessory
    prayer in order to emphasize the priority of God’s action and
    blessing in the ministries of the church

[^13]: The creed expresses the unity of the faith which binds together
    the whole congregation and the people of God of all ages. This
    united confession prepares the congregation for the Lord’s Supper,
    in which they will as one confessing body partake of the body and
    blood the Lord. I have not specified a particular creed, though the
    sake of memorization I would keep the number of creeds used from
    week to week small. I would personally recommend the Apostles Creed,
    the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed.

[^14]: Having confessed the essentials of the faith, those for whom such
    a confession is not true are warmed against partaking unworthily,
    are those in unrepentant sin and unreconciled relationships (which
    are also denials of the truths expressed in the creed).

[^15]: The words of institution provide both the remembrance and the
    command to celebrate the supper. The words themselves do not
    consecrate, but are placed first in order to emphasize the priority
    of Christ’s action both in time and in our life as a corporate body.

[^16]: The Eucharistic prayer enfolds other traditional elements of the
    Eucharistic service such as the sursum corda and the epiclesis. It
    is placed after the *Verba* for the reasons outlined above.

[^17]: Before partaking of the elements and communing with their Lord,
    worshippers are invited to express their communion with one another
    by passing the peace in a culturally appropriate manner.

[^18]: The congregation is invited to thank God for this means of grace
    the fellowship they have with Christ and one another through song.
    The themes of such songs may include the anticipation of Christ’s
    return, the communion of the saints, or the resurrection. This
    particular hymn was chosen to reflect the communion of the saints,
    with the third stanza reflecting some themes from the sermon.

[^19]: As the last element in the liturgy, the benediction should remind
    the congregation of the blessing they have from God as they go about
    the rest of the week.
